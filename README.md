  -Enter the container's terminal via the `docker exec -it car_shop bash` command.
  - Inside the container, install the necessary dependencies using the `npm install` command.
  - Finally, still inside the container's terminal, to initialize the API, use the `npm run dev` command.
  > The API is on port `3001` on localhost.
